Hi,
Welcome to another personal blog, maybe your 31st one today. If you feel - wow, there's one more sapien putting out all the random ideas for views and even silly, considering of making it a living, I can relate to you! With the intrusion of technology into our curious lives, I see blogs popping up everyday. Some about food, some about Politics, some about experiences and most of them about it-is-cool-how-I-learned-stuff-two-seconds-ago-and-I-am-writing-about-it-already. 

This is not one such. This is purely mine. This is not for the second person, their views or reviews. This is just me blurting out what I can think of. Random. On sunny days. On gloomy days. While doing something else. Hoping to do something else. Anything and everything.

If you can relate to it, add plus one to your who-shares-my-perspective list. If you cannot, add to your who-have-a-different-perspective list. Ah, if you feel whatever, you can add it to your whatever list. In this World where you are expected to constantly learn and strengthen your perspectives, it may be challenging to understand that I was messing with ya!

Oops. Share a little joy? Reading stuff with open mind. 
Muscles don't stiffen up. Inner self doesn't pester you. All the reading just fills you! 

Hoping to note down perspectives, to go back and change them, Prana Creates. Happy Reading, here and elsewhere!
